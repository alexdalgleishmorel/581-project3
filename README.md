# Proxemic Mirror
### By Alex Dalgleish-Morel

## How it works

This app simulates a smart mirror and the associated mobile app.

Users should approach the mirror, wait for it to assign you a user ID, and the react to the clothes it shows you!

When positioning your face close to the camera, you will be presented with smaller accessories like necklaces, hats or glasses.

When stepping away 6ft or so from the mirror, you will instead be presented with clothing such as shirts, t-shirts, jerseys and dresses.

By ***smiling***, the app will add that clothing to your list of liked items. By acting ***surprised***, the app will not add that item to your liked list, and will skip to the next item. If that item was previously in your liked list, it will remove it.

Click on any added item in the mobile app to be taken to its product website.
